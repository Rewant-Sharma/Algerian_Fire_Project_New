# Algerian_Fire_Project_New
*The aim of this Project is to process and clean the dataset, generate visualizations, and derive insights from the Algerian forest fire dataset by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI). This analysis will involve utilizing multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularization models. Additionally, the Project will include performing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate the model's performance. After developing the model, you will create pickle files and test the model on unseen data.*

The project contains 3 folders :
1.Dataset folder contains the csv data file.
2.Notebook folder contains the .ipynb file 
3.Pickle files folder containing all the pickle files created
